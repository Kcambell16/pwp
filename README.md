personal website project


## Milestone 1 Feedback
Great job on your Purpose. It starts the document off very strong and provides a clear view of what your site will look like wen completed.
Your Audience goes perfectly with the Purpose - great job on that too. In your Goal, you clearly specify what kind of employer you would like to attract to the site, very well done. I also want to commend 
you on what you say about focusing on front end design - this is a huge part of the personal website, especially if you're using it for employment purposes.

Based on Purpose, Audience, and Goal - it seems you have a good grasp on what you want to accomplish, and exactly how to do that. Good job!


Your Persona works very well with the above points - although I'd suggest you watch your spelling and grammar on future projects - that being said, the persona you described would be exactly the kind of person you should look for when getting hired to a startup.
You also do a good job of explaining what type of business Bryan runs - "fast paced ever evolving team." 


Also - the structure of your HTML code is great! Keep it up!


### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Watch out for grammar and spelling. You wouldn't want Bryan coming to your site to hire you only to see spelling errors.
- In the future, watch out for your directory structuring. We specified in the documentation that you place your milestone 1 code in a directory named "documentation" which is a subdirectory under "public_html". This will help you be more organized in future projects when you have tons of code for different sections - plus it's a good thing to practice.



####Overall, you did a great job on this, with only some small errors that are easily fixed. You've passed Milestone 1 in Tier III! You may now proceed to Milestone 2.

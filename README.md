## Milestone 1 Feedback
Great job on your Purpose. It starts the document off very strong and provides a clear view of what your site will look like wen completed.
Your Audience goes perfectly with the Purpose - great job on that too. In your Goal, you clearly specify what kind of employer you would like to attract to the site, very well done. I also want to commend 
you on what you say about focusing on front end design - this is a huge part of the personal website, especially if you're using it for employment purposes.

Based on Purpose, Audience, and Goal - it seems you have a good grasp on what you want to accomplish, and exactly how to do that. Good job!


Your Persona works very well with the above points - although I'd suggest you watch your spelling and grammar on future projects - that being said, the persona you described would be exactly the kind of person you should look for when getting hired to a startup.
You also do a good job of explaining what type of business Bryan runs - "fast paced ever evolving team." 


Also - the structure of your HTML code is great! Keep it up!


### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Watch out for grammar and spelling. You wouldn't want Bryan coming to your site to hire you only to see spelling errors.
- In the future, watch out for your directory structuring. We specified in the documentation that you place your milestone 1 code in a directory named "documentation" which is a subdirectory under "public_html". This will help you be more organized in future projects when you have tons of code for different sections - plus it's a good thing to practice.



####Overall, you did a great job on this, with only some small errors that are easily fixed. You've passed Milestone 1 in Tier III! You may now proceed to Milestone 2.

Great wireframes! I like the design, and it should be relatively easy to recreate using actual code on your website.

Using the Bootstrap framework, it shouldn't be too difficult to create the columns and slider sections that you've laid out in your wireframes. Use any extra time that you have to gather assets for your website such as images, content, and any other information you'll need for the final site. You should also spend some time thinking about color scheme, fonts, and branding (logos, for example) that you'll want. 

When creating a resume site, it may be a good idea to include links to your professional social media accounts - LinkedIn, for example, and maybe professional Facebook and Twitter accounts if you have them. If this interests you, look into FontAwesome (http://fontawesome.io/) as they have many prebuilt logos that you can easily incorporate into the design and code of the website. 


If you are considering using an image slider on your "My Work" section, the Bootstrap framework does have an image slider included, but it's not that great. If this is a feature you're interested in having on the site, take a look at the [Flickity Slider](http://flickity.metafizzy.co/), the [Owl Carosel](http://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/) or [Slick](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/). These are only a few of many available slider options out there, and these are mobile/touch friendly.

For custom fonts, I recommend using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

Prior to our in-class coverage on the Bootstrap framework, have a look at the [Official Bootstrap Documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/) and the [Deep Dive Bootstrap Material](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/bootstrap/).

When you do begin development, you'll build your page on `index.php` directly inside your `/public_html` directory.



Really nice work here. Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).




### Edits &amp; Suggestions for Future Development
- Make sure you use a professional headshot (or atleast not a selfie) for your picture at the top of the finished site. 
- The navigation buttons at the top of your site may not be needed for a one-page design unless they're anchor buttons that scroll to the specific location on the page that you want to display. One suggestion I would have is to keep the Resume button on the navbar, but make it a downloadable link - then, remove the Resume image that you have on your actual page, because it would be basically unreadable on a mobile screen. 
- Your slider on the desktop version is a great idea, but I see that you're just using thumbnail images on the mobile version. This will be a pain to incorporate because you will be using two third party tools that may not work well together. It may be a good idea to use either a slider for both desktop and mobile, or thumbnail images for both. 
  - Speaking of your thumbnail images - what are you planning on doing with these? Will they create a Boostrap Lightbox? Or possibly pop up information via a Modal? Think about this as you proceed.
- Your mobile version may be VERY compressed and difficult to build using the 2 column design that you created. It may look perfect at certain pixel widths, such as on an Iphone 6 Plus - and it may look terrible on an iphone 4 screen. Consider this when you're building the site, as it may be a good idea to just have the content filling up one column so they're responsive on a mobile device.


In your HTML Code, you forgot to close the head tag, and your body tag's indention is off. Not a big deal, but make sure you code looks as good as the front end of your site is going to look!
